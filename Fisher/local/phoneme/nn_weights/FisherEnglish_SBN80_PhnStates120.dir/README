  README FILE FOR LATTICE GENERATION
======================================================

This set of scripts and models allow for generating phoneme lattices using HTK tool HVite. It has the same functionality like BUT phoneme recognizer from 
http://speech.fit.vutbr.cz/cs/software/phoneme-recognizer-based-long-temporal-context

The main script is phnrec.sh with 2 parameters
 1) input posterior file in HTK feature file format
 2) output name for lattice and counts file

example: phnrec.sh ../../example/example.post.fea  example
this would generate 
   - example.latt.gz with lattice 
   - example.count.gz with phoneme counts from the lattice

There are some script modifications needed mainly at the beggining of the script - especially setting the correct path for the binaries (HList, HVite, lattice-tool)

All the models and configuration files were generated using init.sh
